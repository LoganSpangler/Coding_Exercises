Background on the Data: 
Slack has a system that allows apps to send alerts to Slack users in 3 channels (banner, push, sidebar). We write a log to a table called "alerts" whenever a user sees an alert (impression or 'imp') or a user clicks on an alert ('clk'). The table contains data for a single day. This logging is new and hasn't been vetted yet. Trust nothing, callout bad data, and work to clean the data as necessary to get the best answer.

Columns in the table:
user_id: numeric, unique and persistent id for each user
team_id: numeric, unique and persistent id for each team. Each userid belongs to exactly one team.
app_id: numeric, unique and persistent id for each app
event: string with values 'imp' (as in impression, so it was seen) or 'clk' (the user interacted with it)
primary_browser: string, the browser the user was using
alert_type: string, alert was in a banner/sidebar/push
eventtime: the timestamp of when the interaction happened

Questions:
#1 What is the best performing alert type?
#2 What apps are the best and worst performing?
#3 Iâ€™m curious about what the first alert a team clicked on in this day? For each alert_type, compute how many teams clicked an alert of that type as their first alert in a day.

Process
You should document your final solution in the left hand pane including any relevant thought process and exploration as well as your final answer to the questions. You may also interact with the data in the right hand pane as you work (but this won't be saved!). We'll be looking at the final product in the left hand pane but may also replay your entire session to see how you worked through the questions.

#28 (CTR = 48.7%, with 80 events)
# 2 (CTR = 45%, with 55 events)
...
#29 (CTR = 40%, with 293 events)

We can probably discard those apps with less than 50 events. So, the rank would look something like this:
Best 3:
#17 (CTR = 67%, with 197 events)
#31 (CTR = 52%, with 284 events)
#28 (CTR = 48.7%, with 80 events)

Worst 3:
#3 (CTR = 34.5%, with 194 events)
#16 (CTR = 34.74%, with 118 events)
#21 (CTR = 35.7%, with 171 events)

I noticed that the most popular app (#15) didn't make it to the rank by CTR. I looked further and realized that all the events for this app are impressions, with 0 clicks. Most likely this could be caused by a log error so I woudl talk with the Engineering team to see why are not capturing clicks for this app.

/* Computing the number of teams that clicked each alert as their first one during this day, we can see that for most of the teams it was a sidebar alert the first one they clicked, which is correlated with the total number of alerts showed in that day. Interestingly banner alert made it to the second place, while there are ~30% more push alerts in this dataset.
This is how the final count looks like for each team:
sidebar_alert: 640  
banner_alert: 292 
push_alert: 225

I remember having count 1440 as total teams previously; but in my results the count adds up to 1157. These might be the teams who actually clicked on an alert during this day, which means that 283 teams didn't click in any of the alerts they received. I checked and that's correct.
